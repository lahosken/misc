Thr33dle
========

A web app that lets you play three games of Wordle at once.
I.e., it's like [Polydle](https://polydle.github.io/?classic/random/3/).

Picking a good "next guess" for three simultaneous Wordle games
ain't easy, so this game can suggest one. Type `?` and the game
will automatically fill in a pretty-good guess.
