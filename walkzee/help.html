  <h1><a href="./">Walkzee</a>: Help</h1>

  <p>Walkzee is a game in which you walk around IRL and
    tap on a map to pick up dice. Put those dice into
    dice-poker hands.  The big green square is a map showing
    dice 1000m in each direction; you can pick up dice up
    to 500m away. If you can't pick up a die because it's too
    far away, walk closer.

  <p>Walkzee uses your phone's "GPS" (geolocation) to know
    if you walked closer. On Android, it'll ask for permission.
    On iPhone, it will silently fail unless you
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iphone+safari+turn+on+geolocation&udm=14">turn on Location Services</a>.
    If you're thinking <i>Why does it say "big green square" when
      I just see a big white square?</i>, that's because your
    phone is failing at geolocation, alas.

  <p>Tap a die to pick it up. You can put it down in a hand or
    in the stash area. Hands are like quests or missions. You're
    trying to complete dice-poker hands. Complete a hand and you
    can press the&nbsp;üèÜ button to exchange the hand for points
    and get a new hand/quest/mission/<var>thingy</var>.

    <div>
      <br> 2x‚ö´ &nbsp;:&nbsp;Pair of ‚öÄ(1)s. 
      <br> &hellip; 
      <br> 2x‚†ø &nbsp;:&nbsp; Pair of ‚öÖ(6)s
      <br> 3x‚ùì &nbsp;:&nbsp; Three of a kind (any kind) 
      <br> 4x‚ùì &nbsp;:&nbsp; Four of a kind (any kind) 
      <br> üè† &nbsp;:&nbsp; Full House, 3x‚ùì&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;2x‚ùì 
      <br> Straight &nbsp;:&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 or 2 3 4 5 6
      <br> 5x‚ùì &nbsp;:&nbsp; Five of a kind (any kind) 
    </div>

  <p>You need five dice to complete a hand. If you're working towards
    a 2x1Ô∏è‚É£, have those two dice and wonder why the üèÜ button is still
    grayed out: You need three more dice.

  <p>Normally the game checks your location about once a minute.
    Don't want to wait a minute? Press the&nbsp;‚åñ button.
