============

Script that fetches an RSS feed and saves an altered version of that feed.
For each link to an image in the original feed, the altered feed adds
the image itself.

Why is this handy? Lemmy sites provide RSS feeds. In these feeds, images
show up as links, not as images. So I have a cron job to run this script
to generate, uhm, enhanced feeds pretty much like the originals, but
showing the graphics instead of plain ol' links.
