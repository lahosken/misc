"weird" performers: places you already "own" instead of new

CLIENT: keep hashes of recently-seen coords. notice if "new" gps is really old

now, a "wildcard" (10 prisms or whatever) can only create new route-strand,
can't append to existing route-strand. some way to pull that mess out into
a new function or something? or else copy-paste?

tombstones: google might tell us about region "san francisco" even if we're
far from its center, just because it's big and we're in it. if the only things
we get from google are further away than our radius,
we should create a tombstone nonetheless

if user tries to check in but it's been less than an hour, don't just
say "can't check in". say {"can't check in", but you can at time=123456789}
so we know to turn the thingy red and when to bring it back

when announcing a gone-region, if the message is going to say
'the region "" went away' (empty region name), maybe don't bother to
say it, right?
