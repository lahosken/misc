CLIENT: that link to wikipedia should go to another tab

not using memo-ized "4sq" places anymore (except TOMBSTONEs)
probably can clean up some of the 4sq cron logic accordingly, yes?
it has a lot of code to deal with "todos" that won't happen.

nowadays the 4sq datastore just holds tombstones. (well, new
things as of sep 19 2018. there's 30-day stuff in there that's
not tombstones for now... but should eventually get cleaned out)
It used to be place data. the relevant struct has a bunch of
fields for that place data. So... maybe a new datastore that's
just { lat, lng, datetime } . and wipe out the old thusly-unused
datastore.
