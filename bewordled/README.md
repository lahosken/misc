Bewordled
=========

Source code for [Bewordled](https://lahosken.san-francisco.ca.us/frivolity/prog/bewordled/), something like one of those gem-matching games
except that you're trying to form words using letters on tiles.

Along with the web-app used to play the game itself, some python
scripts I used to figure out a forgiving set of letter-tiles that
are likely to combine to form words.
