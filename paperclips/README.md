paperclips.js
=============

Automatically plays the
[Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html)
game.
(The game is probably more fun to play "by hand" than by watching this
code do things automatically. But if you're in the mood to make an
automatic Universal Paperclips-player, this code might be a good start.)

To use, go to the game page, open up the Javascript terminal, paste
in the code and:

```javascript

tick = setInterval(doStuff, 1);

```

Later on, if you want to shut the code down, you can

```javascript

clearInterval(tick);

```
